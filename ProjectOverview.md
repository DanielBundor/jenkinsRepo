DevOps CI/CD Project with Jenkins
Project Overview

This project demonstrates setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins for a GitHub repository. The pipeline automates building, testing, and deploying a sample web application to a staging environment.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Jenkins Server: Set up a Jenkins server. You can use Jenkins on a standalone server, a virtual machine, or a cloud-based service like AWS EC2.
2. GitHub Repository: Create a GitHub repository for your project.
3. Docker: Install Docker on the Jenkins server for containerization.
4. GitHub Access Token: Generate a GitHub personal access token with the necessary permissions for Jenkins to access your GitHub repository.

Jenkins Pipeline Setup

1. Install Required Plugins: Install the necessary plugins in Jenkins, such as GitHub, Pipeline, Docker, and any others required for your specific project.
2. Configure Global Credentials: Add your GitHub personal access token as a secret credential in Jenkins.
3. Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job:
Create a new Jenkins pipeline job using a Jenkinsfile.
Configure the pipeline to trigger automatically when changes are pushed to your GitHub repository.
4. Jenkinsfile Configuration:
Create a Jenkinsfile in the root of your project repository.
Define the pipeline stages, including building, testing, and deploying your application.

Use a Jenkinsfile script similar to the example below:
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t my-app .'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker run my-app test'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy Staging') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Deployment to staging successful!'
        }
    }
}

Customize the stages and commands according to your project's requirements.
5. Webhook Setup:
Set up a webhook in your GitHub repository to trigger the Jenkins pipeline when changes are pushed.
6. Pipeline Parameters (Optional): If needed, configure parameters for your pipeline job to allow for manual input or customization.
